# Open Ping for iOS

This is a plain application that allows you to ping a domain or an IP (IPv4). Main use cases:

1. Check if the internet is down
2. Check if a host is up
3. Check if a hosit in another subnet can be reached (f.i. within a VPN)

## Install / Download

The app is not yet published on the App Store

## Hey, merlos, why did you create Open Ping?
During a lot of time I used [Mocha Ping Lite](https://mochasoft.dk/iphone_ping.htm) which was fine and free. I only used the ping a single IP, and I usually pinged a few IPs or domains... but main problem was accessing the history. Most of the time I just wanted to ping some domain or IP that I already pinged in the past, I wanted to tap on the domain. So, one day I did some research on existing libraries, et voil√°.
